        <h1>Unknown Relationship: Between Love and Waiting 💔⏳</h1>

   <h2>“The Beginning of Something Special”</h2>

   <h2>November 14th 🗓️</h2>

   <p>I first saw Rupa on the morning of November 14th 🗓️ while going to college on the 111V bus 🚌 on a Thursday.</p>

   <p>Seeing her every day made me wonder—was it love ❤️ or just attraction? 🤔 That day marked the beginning of something special ✨.</p>

   <p>I found out some details about Rupa, such as the year she joined 📚, whether she was a lateral entry or regular student 🎓, and if she had a boyfriend 💔.</p>

   <p>She was a lateral entry student from Vizag Birla Junction 🚉 and had no interest in love ❤️‍🩹.</p>

   <br>

   <h2>Nov 23rd, Saturday 📅</h2>

   <p>That day, when I saw her, I was completely captivated by her cute eyes 👀, her beautiful smile 😊, and her pink dress 👗.</p>

   <p>She had a pink butterfly-shaped hair clip 🦋 that caught my attention.</p>

   <p>While looking at her, I was speechless—words just couldn’t express how I felt. 😶💫</p>

   <br>

   <h2>Jan 10th, 2025 📅</h2>

   <p>We went to the ISKCON temple 🛕 with my friends Revanth, Vamshi, and Poojitha.</p>

   <p>After that, we visited Bheemunipatnam (Bheemili) beach 🌊.</p>

   <p>There, I told Rupa that I want to marry her 💍❤️.</p>

   <p>But I also told her that I’m not interested in love or a relationship right now. I asked her to give me 5 years after my graduation to succeed in life, and then I would talk to my parents.</p>
   
   <br>


   <h2>“From Silence to Something More”</h2>

   <p>After the January 10th incident, she started talking to me again by the end of February 🗓️. An emotional attachment grew between us 💞, but our relationship didn’t have a name ❓. Things were going well at first—full of laughter 😂, fun times 🎉, and shared moments 🌟.</p>

   <p>But like every story, we also faced fights 😠, sadness 😢, and misunderstandings 🤐. Despite all that, those ups and downs made our bond stronger and more real 💪❤️.</p>

   <br>


   <h2>“When Misunderstandings Took Over”</h2>

   <p>From February until now, many misunderstandings happened between us—too many to count 😞. I have some anger issues 😠, and when I show my anger, she finds it hard to handle and sometimes gets scared 😟. When I shout, she takes it as a misunderstanding between us.</p>

   <p>However, if our fights are caused by someone else, she can’t take it and often shouts back at me 😡. During those moments, I tell her repeatedly that I will never talk to her again, and she replies, “It’s okay.” But after two days, I always go back and talk to her again, because I can’t stay away 💔.</p>


   <br>

   <h2>“The Silent Battle of Love and Anger”</h2>

   <p>After meeting Rupa, I started focusing on my life and success. I’m trying my best to get a job in this final year 🎓💼.</p>

   <p>But I have one fear—the fear that she might not stay in my life 😟. I struggle a lot with my anger and possessiveness, and I can’t seem to control them 😞.</p>

   <p>This is all new to me. From November 13th until now, August 13th, I don’t understand why I feel such strong possessiveness. I can’t afford to spend money like you do 💸, but one day, I will spend for you when my situation improves. Right now, I can ask money from my parents, and they will give it to me, but I know how much they struggle to provide that support 🙏.</p>

   <p>So, I really can’t afford to waste money. You might think I have a lot of anger issues 😠, but the truth is, when I shout at you, it’s just the fear of losing you talking inside me 😟💔.</p>

   <p>Right now, I’m surviving on just 1% hope—that things will work out, that success will come, and that she will stay with me 🙏.</p>

   <p>I know there’s a 99% chance I might lose her, but even knowing that, I just can’t accept it 💔.</p>

   <p>You might think all this is just a way to make you fall in love with me ❤️‍🔥, but I want to tell you again and again that I’m not interested in love or a relationship right now 🚫💕. Just support me in my goal to get married 💍, and please wait for the next five years ⏳🙏.</p>
